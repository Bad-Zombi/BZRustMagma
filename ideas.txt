friends
unfriend

--------------------

help
add core function for saving and displaying help stuff

---------------------

starter
loadout
Make kits. allow for special VIP kit and integrate website with it

	---
		create plugin that rewards people for inviting friends. if a person types /ref <name> the parson named gets a referral point and some sort of bonus
	---
----------------

location
just add location message when rust++ is removed. maybe change to loc and add the old map marked thing from the oxide plugin back in 

--------------

players
better player list. Admins / VIPs / Players
maybe add last on so ppl can type /last <name> and see when a person last visited (x hours ago, more than x hours ago)

------------
pm
r
simple pm and respond plugin

-------------
rules
join message
repeating message
just a simple mesages thing

--------------

saveall
will need a new way to do this after rust++ is removed. add it to the core.

-----------------

share
unshare
not really sure how/if I wanna do this but if I do it should include traps stuff

----------------------

remover
incorporate with structure recycler. when remove tool is active they have a chance to get back the whole thing. (config)
when not active and/or its someone elses stuff they get back a percentage of the resources it was created from

-------------------
goodgod plugin:

	supposed to make admin more transparent
	broadcast when admin turns on godmode
	remind admin they have godmode on every 15 seconds
	when admin has god mode on and is hit:
		give ammo back to user
		notify user that admin has god mode on
		notify admin they have godmode on

	when admin is hit while admin gear is equipped
		give ammo back to user
		notify admin they are invisible
		notify player they hit an invisible admin

	check for and repair injury on damage
	check for and repair bleeding (if possible) on damage


------------

make something that updates website with plugins and verison numbers. (BZplugins)

------------

/take X item : split off a specific amount of something into a fre einventory slot.
/drop X item

------------

rather than banks... people can bury their money in a location of their choosing. maybe save them to a map or offer some sort of reminders ... 
commands would be "/bury 100" or "/dig 100" or something when standing within x meters of the mark.

------------------

change kill type on PVP death to hide killers identity?

------------

fix notification in poke plugin. either remember and ignore last poke on repeat or filter out damage types to just a hatchet or bow for distance shots (or something like that)

-----------

turn server decay on
on decay event check for last time a player was on. if its within the time slot... dont decay

-------

see if it supports checking for function.

if so... move all the plugin details to datastore (at least version)

find out if there is a better way to have plugin data stored (other than plugin.value - whatever)

update all plugins to use this check and make master function in core so we canhave a simple requirement check

------------------------------------

add perks for various levels... set/find traps, hide sleeper, foraging, gather bonus, gear mantainance etc.

---------------------

loot tables

--------------------

crafting tables

----------------------

exp system

-----------------

make table for traps cost. just resources, eg... lqm, wood planks, etc.


--------------

rework data dump script to make it work deeper. recusive. may not be needed with mikec's script stuff.
------------

proficiency system... a users starts with 0xp in each weapon (possibly other things too)
as user gets more hits/kills with the item their xp goes up and they gain levels.
lowest levels have a chance of accident like blowing self up with c4 or setting it wrong... shooting self in the foot etc.
once user hits a "mid" level their damage gets increased as they add new levels.
( start at -100xp   mid level is 0xp  damage increases up to +100xp)

when a player dies if they are below o0x nothing changes... if they are above 0px they lose half of their extra xp.

(user has -20 xp and they die... they start at -10xp  || user as +50xp and they die, they restart with +25 xp)

earning of xp slows the higher they get over 0xp

this could apply to hunting where they get bonus meat or something the better a hunter they are (aside from increased damage)

possibly do it for gathering as well so they gather faster or get more resources from a node.

maybe the same system could be used for picking locks?

----------------

public bounty

player can place a bounty on another player.
bounty is removed from players inventory and public notice is posted
when hit is complete the killer gets the reward instantly and server is notified
players can check bounties with command

--------------------------------------------------------------------

lockpicking...

a user has a lockpick in their belt and face a door. they type /pick ## where ## is between 1 and 100

the system comes up with a secret value range (e.g. 20 - 30)

if the users number is between those values, the door will open.

if using the proficiency system the secret number range is larger up to a 50% value?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

rewrite arrow system fo animal instances are tracked. you can only reclaim arrows that have actually been fired into that animal.

maybe just have total arrows and try to decide how many to give from that total based on size of animal or something like that

when a player is hit with arrows the datastore will track what time it happened... if it was within 10 minutes or so the arrow can be reclaimed when they die.

if possible put arrows in dropped pack rather than just giving them directly to the player... should be easiest for reds and players... maybe see if animals can drop packs.

if possible make it so animals give arrows back as harvest items.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

when a player destroys a building part with explosives or pickaxe or whatever they will reclaim a percentage of the raw materials used to make the item

when they remove their own item they will have a chance of getting the whole thing or a higher percentage of getting resources back.

possibly tie in with proficiency syste... the more you have built the more you will get back and/or the higher the chance of getting back a whole item.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

make a purchaseable trap setup... when created, user must have appropriate number of credits in inventory or wallet or whatever.

player tags a storage box or stash that is sitting on a ceiling (maybe can work for doors too for blowing them up or opening/picking them)

when a player other than them opens or destroys the stash or door the related ceiling vanishes for like 3 seconds and then is replaced... means user can place a trap room or spikes or something underneath it... 

would work best with doors since the storage sitting on the ceiling would probably be destroyed in the process and may not be recreatable easily with the same instance id

possible scenario... stand in front of door and type /settrap ... targeted door will open and close of owned by user.  user then must "hit" the activated ceiling object with a melee weapon to identify it. 

trap is saved in the traps datastore unded door instance... each trap will get a random number of uses. once its all used up, the user will get a notification of some sort.

------

close all doors at certain times?

open all doors when a user is banned?

------

betting system for dueals and battles and such.

--

admin plugin to change name and/or change another players name?

----

plugins add help text to datastore when loaded so the help text is dynamic

---

add indivisual help text where appropriate

--- 

make sure all the admin functions are limited to admin

---

add server ip to post checking... to make sure no one can fudge posts.

---

maybe make a new token on server init and use that for updates rather than the 

---

godmode stuff. change name to "Admin GODmode" or something when active...
also send popup to admin and attacked if he is hit with godmode on so there are no mistakes.
